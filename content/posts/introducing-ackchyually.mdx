I’ve been building a little tool that I wish existed years ago.

You know the moment when you *mostly* remember a command, but not quite?

- You type `--prety` instead of `--pretty`.
- You put flags in the wrong place.
- You reach for a subcommand that *does* exist… just not on *this* tool.

When it’s me at the keyboard, I fix it and move on. When it’s an AI agent running commands, it often turns into a little loop of `--help`, scrolling, and retries.

So I made **ackchyually**.

It’s the “ackchyually…” friend for your CLI: it remembers what worked (per repo) and suggests the right command when you get the details wrong.

If you want the short version: https://ackchyually.sh

## What it does

**ackchyually** sits in front of your existing tools (like `git`, `gh`, etc.) using shims.

When you run a command successfully, it remembers the invocation for *that repo*.

Later, if you typo something and the tool errors, ackchyually can nudge you with something that worked before *here*.

That “here” part matters. The right command in one repo is not always the right command in another.

## Installing it

Install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ackchyually.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Then install shims for the tools you want it to help with:

```bash
ackchyually shim install git gh
```

And persist the shim directory at the front of your `PATH`:

```bash
ackchyually shim enable
```

To confirm it’s wired up correctly, use `which`:

```bash
which git
# ~/.local/share/ackchyually/shims/git
```

If `which` prints something else, your shim directory isn’t first in `PATH` yet.

## A quick example

Here’s a very real kind of failure:

```bash
git log -1 --prety=%s
```

Git complains. Ackchyually can respond with a “this worked before here” suggestion:

```bash
git log -1 '--pretty=%s'
```

It’s not trying to be magic. It’s just giving you a fast path back to something you already proved works in this repo.

## Why I’m excited about it

This started as a tool for *me*, but it’s become even more useful with agents in the loop.

If you’re building an agent that touches your terminal, you want it to:

- stay in PTY mode for interactive commands
- avoid breaking existing CLI behavior
- make fewer “let me check the help output again” calls

That’s the whole vibe of ackchyually.

If you try it and it feels helpful (or if it feels annoying in a specific way), I’d love to hear about it:

- Site: https://ackchyually.sh
- GitHub: https://github.com/joelklabo/ackchyually

## Conclusion

I’m going to keep iterating on this until it feels like a genuinely useful teammate.

If you’ve ever yelled “I *know* this command…”, this tool is for you.
