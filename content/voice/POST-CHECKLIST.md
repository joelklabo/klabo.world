# Post Checklist (klabo.world)

A fast, repeatable pass before publishing.

## Voice

- Start with a sharp claim in the first 3–5 lines.
- Earn the claim with one concrete example (not “importance” language).
- Use short punchy lines when it lands.
- Avoid generic LLM meta phrasing.

## Structure

- Headings are Title Case.
- Lists start with a capital letter.
- Prefer “Before vs Now” artifacts (lists/diagrams/checklists).

## Visuals

- If you use a metaphor, consider a callout (blockquote).
- Keep code blocks minimal; use lists when it’s actually a process.
- Use one strong embedded tweet section at most; don’t let it replace your voice.

## Finish

- End with a punchy 1-line takeaway.
- Read it once on mobile width; remove any “UI chrome” feeling (overly heavy widgets).
