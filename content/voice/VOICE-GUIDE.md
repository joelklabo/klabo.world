## Non-negotiables (manual)

- Prefer concrete claims + examples over “importance” language.
- Use short punchy lines when it lands.
- Avoid generic “LLM meta” phrasing (no apologies, no "as an AI", no filler).

## Phrases to avoid (manual)

- "underscores"
- "in conclusion"
- "it is important to note"

## Preferred moves (manual)

- Start with a sharp claim, then earn it.
- Use contrast (“before vs after”) and explicit tradeoffs.
- Add a human constraint: time, attention, decision fatigue, actual workflow.
