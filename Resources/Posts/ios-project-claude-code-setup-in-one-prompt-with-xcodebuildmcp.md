I have been using Claude Code for a month or so now. I have created a `CLAUDE.md` and set up and MCP server but hadn't really done much to configure Claude better. The amount of options was a little overwhelming and "configuration" is not something that really peaks my interest usually.

I kept seeing examples of other projects with very precise and useful configuration though, and I knew I was not getting the best I could out of the tool.

So, I decided to ask Claude to do it for me. I won't go into too much detail because I'll post the steps I took below. And, a single prompt you can use to do the same for your iOS project.

If you are like me, just run this and let Claude improve your setup for you.

## The prompt

This comprehensive prompt will transform any iOS project into a fully automated, context-aware, self-maintaining Claude Code environment with XcodeBuildMCP integration.

## The workflow

This shows the step-by-step approach I used to transform my iOS project with Claude Code, including priming with `/init`, integrating XcodeBuildMCP, creating self-healing maintenance commands, and building a one-shot setup prompt for any iOS repository.
